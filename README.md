## Vision
CardanoTalk aims to create a next-generation social media platform that empowers users with decentralized governance, user control over data, and incentivized engagement. Leveraging Cardano's scalable and secure blockchain, the platform will redefine how people connect online.

## Core Features
1. **User Profiles**: Customizable avatars, bios, and personal details.
2. **Microblogging (Posts)**: Short posts with a character limit, similar to tweets.
3. **Hashtags**: Categorization and discoverability of posts.
4. **Likes/Upvotes and Comments**: User engagement through feedback.
5. **Followers/Following**: Social connections and network building.
6. **Direct Messaging**: Secure private communication.
7. **Trending Topics**: Real-time updates on popular discussions.
8. **Content Moderation**: Community-based voting or DAO-driven governance.
9. **Incentivization**: Earn tokens for activities like posting, liking, and referring others.

## Architecture Overview
CardanoTalk integrates several components:

- **Frontend**: A web-based interface for user interaction (built with React/Angular).
- **Backend**: API services for authentication, data management, and Cardano interaction (Node.js or Python).
- **Blockchain**: Smart contracts written in Plutus to handle incentivization, governance, and data storage.
- **Storage**: Decentralized solutions like IPFS for media and user data.
